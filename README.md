# `harper-tree-sitter-dart`

This repository contains a grammar for the Dart language for Tree-sitter.
More specifically, it is the grammar from the now-archived [`tree-sitter-dart` repository](https://github.com/ast-grep/tree-sitter-dart).
This repo exists to maintain Dart support for [Harper](https://github.com/automattic/harper).

Feel free to use this package however you want, but do not expect support in addition to that provided through Harper itself.
